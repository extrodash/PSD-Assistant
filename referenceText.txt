Service Missionary Contributions within the Publishing Services Department (PSD)

This document outlines the roles, projects, and operational context of service missionaries contributing to the Publishing Services Department (PSD) at the Church Office Building of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

### I. Introduction: Contextualizing Missionary Service within Church Publishing Operations

Role of Publishing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:
Since its inception, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has emphasized publishing to disseminate doctrines, support global membership, and document history. The Publishing Services Department (PSD) handles a wide array of media from the Church Office Building (COB) in Salt Lake City, Utah. This includes scriptures, manuals, magazines, digital resources, and audiovisual materials, fundamental for teaching the gospel and strengthening faith worldwide.

Contribution of Service Missionaries to Church Operations:
The Church utilizes a robust service missionary program alongside its proselytizing efforts. Service missionaries dedicate time and talents to support Church operational needs, including Young Service Missionaries (YCSM) and Senior Service Missionaries. They contribute significantly at Church Headquarters and other locations, filling essential roles that support the Church's global mission efficiently. This leverages member commitment, addressing needs that might otherwise require additional paid staff.

Understanding the "Service Project Shop" Concept:
The term "Service Project Shop" is not an official department name within PSD but likely refers to a functional area or collection of project-based service opportunities where missionaries contribute. It suggests a hands-on, practical environment for tangible contributions, distinct from purely administrative or ecclesiastical roles. This report explores these service opportunities.

Our Purpose:
"Serving...as the Savior would" - Service Missionary Purpose
Elevate His Work - How can you elevate the service you are doing to be more Christ-like?
As Service Project Shop Missionary, you are expected to strive to serve in alignment with Service Missionary Standards (review 2.1.6  and 2.2 ), Church Employee guidelines, and the SPS Policies.
BACKGROUND
It’s easy to lose perspective about the work of the Lord at Headquarters. Thrilling opportunities and honored responsibilities can, over time, be reduced to mere tasks, recurring meetings, and obligatory commitments. But we recognized years ago that because of their humility and the power of their call, Service Missionaries remind us of the peace, purpose, and joy of the Lord’s work. We witnessed that they not only got the work done, but they also changed us and our perspectives. So rather than focusing on doing tasks employees would otherwise be doing, we have focused on elevating the work at Church Headquarters. Here’s the difference this focus has made:
TEAMS
The missionaries who serve here are not just focused on preparing for future post-mission opportunities or on reaching work quotas; they are here because they love the Lord and want to serve Him. They use their unique talents to build capability of others, improve the work, and produce their best on a variety of creative, business and physical service projects. Missionaries don’t work exclusively on one type of project, rather they are assigned by team leads to projects where they can do the most good. 
The missionaries have positive interactions with employees regularly. Whether they are reporting on completed work, helping to organize future efforts, or simply seeing employees in elevators and hallways. The missionaries are always looking for ways to interact in simple, Christlike ways. 
SERVICES
We offer service projects for creative, administrative, analysis, data processing, communication, design, organization, and physical service needs. Lead missionaries are assigned to shepherd each project and seek to establish a positive service relationship with the requestor. 
We have also sent many missionaries to serve directly with employee teams on a short-term basis. We call these assignments. As they serve there, they often become trusted members of the team, introducing others to the power of service missionaries and elevating the culture of the teams on which they serve. These more intimate service assignments regularly lead requestors to create their own service operations into which they welcome missionaries directly from local missions.
MARKETING
Most of our marketing is done through positive relationships that the missionaries form with Church departments. But we also encourage teams throughout the Church to highlight in their meetings good service offered by employees and missionaries. These are featured in weekly stories of service emails sent to over 20,000 employees of the Church. These efforts don’t just highlight our group, but the value of service throughout Church Headquarters.

Be eager to serve! "And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord". - Colossians 3:23
Projects come to us from all over, and they vary in service type, length, etc. We need to be prepared to serve as needed and strive to Elevate His Work. Take heed from hymn #270 I'll Go Where You Want Me to Go. This is hymn is a perfect example of being willing to do the work of the Lord in whatever capacity he gives us. Strive to follow its advice on doing it his way. 

Productivity. Understand that although we try to assign projects based on your interests and skills, not every project that you get to work on will be the most exciting thing in the world. We expect all missionaries to be thoroughly engaged in their service and continuously working on projects during our service time, regardless of whether you think it's interesting.
Office Etiquette Keep distractions and unnecessary conversations to a minimum during service hours in order to maintain a level of reverence for the work and missionaries around you. When you do need to talk with another missionary, try to keep the volume level to a whisper. Think of how you would act if you were in the temple for a reference. 

Communication will be an important part of your service in a large operation with many moving parts. You will need to communicate with missionaries, employees and others depending on you. You also need to communicate with your Team Lead about things such as your schedule , out-of-office days, needing more/less work, and other needs (things that may affect your service). Check Teams, Outlook, and Airtable regularly. Your Team Lead is your point of contact so reach out to them with any issues that may come up. Avoid sending messages to the SPS Missionaries chat that are not applicable to everybody (such as if you are late, sick, etc). 

Be organized and involved. You are expected to serve a minimum of 3 days/week, exceptions may be made by managers in some situations. You will also be expected to stick to the hours of the shop which are from 9am - 4pm. Be on time as best you can each day and, not leave. Be willing to lead Gospel Study or give a morning thought when you are assigned to.

Attendance You will need to attend all Team and Project meetings, as well as your weekly one on one with your Team Leads. These are all required meetings that need to be attended in order for the Shop, projects, and teams to run smoothly.

Keywords for Chatbot: choosing project participants, assigning missionaries, project staffing, coordinator role, portfolio manager role, team lead role

Guidelines for Inviting Missionaries to Projects: When inviting missionaries, first and foremost, follow the direction of the Spirit; this is paramount. Collaborate closely with Portfolio Managers, Team Leadership, and possibly Tyler Smith (PSD Manager) to identify suitable missionaries, often utilizing Assignment Meetings for these discussions. Consider missionaries who may need more tasks, but always prioritize suitability for the project; do not invite those who would not do well, even if they require more service hours. Communicate with the individual missionary and their Team Lead to determine their potential fit. Avoid overfilling projects by assessing actual needs. Verify that potential participants can attend weekly project meetings or stay adequately informed. Finally, clearly communicate all project expectations and ensure each participant's commitment to their role and responsibilities.

If unresolved, inform the missionary's Team Lead and, if necessary, meet together with the individual and their Team Lead. 3. If the issue persists, refer it to Tyler Smith (PSD Manager). 4. As a last resort, after consultation, inform the Team Lead about dismissing the participant from the project.

Strive for clear and continuous communication with the Project Requestor, asking clarifying questions to fully understand their needs and informing them of the service capabilities and limitations. 3. Adjust project participation by adding or removing individuals as needs change, always informing the relevant Portfolio Manager and Team Leads of these adjustments.

PSD finance Download Sheet Instructions
Step 1: Access Plunet
Go to the Plunet website—the church’s translation invoice system. Sign in when you have
access.
Step 2: Export Payables from Plunet
From the Plunet homepage, go to "Payables" and click "All." Use the Options menu to export to
Excel. Open the exported file in Excel. If Excel asks, click "Convert." After this, you’re done
with Plunet—everything else happens in Excel.
Step 3: Prepare the Excel File
In Excel, select all rows by clicking the triangle at the top left. Then, go to Sort & Filter, choose
Sort, and pick Smallest to Largest to sort invoices. The list is now sorted.
Step 4: Check and Update the Download Sheet
Open the Plunet Finances File. Go to the Download Sheet tab, then the Download Sheet1 tab,
and the Working Invoice Download tab. There’s also a General tab.
Now, look at the third column in the Download Sheet for a star symbol (*).
• If there’s no star, the sheet isn’t complete. Add any new invoices to the bottom.
• If there is a star, cross-check with the IAN batch archive paid file (in the finance drive,
under plunet finance, in the 2025 folder). Make sure the newest invoice in Excel matches
the newest in the archive.
Step 5: Update Working Invoice Download (WID)
Find the last invoice number in Excel (Column A). Copy all data from the Download Sheet into
the General sheet. Grab the most recent invoice numbers, vendor names, and vendor IDs, then
paste those into the Working Invoice Download, matching the columns.
Color code meanings:
• Yellow: Agency invoice – delete it.
• Blue: WUBS – keep it and send to Lisa.
• Green: Myanmar invoices – keep it and send to Lisa.
• Red: Duplicate or Russian invoices – exclude these from the download/delete.
• Orange: GFS – keep it, send to Lisa, and record the payment manually in IAN.
• When you’re done, clear all color filters.
Step 6: Finish Up the Working Invoice Download Sheet
Copy all data from the Working Invoice Download and paste it back into the Download Sheet.
Save the Download Sheet and close it. Do not save the Working Invoice Download. Close both
Working Invoice Download and General sheets.
Step 7: Notify
Tell Lisa you’re done with the download process so she can process the invoices officially.
Reality check:
This whole thing is about accuracy and airtight records. Miss a step or get sloppy, and you’ll
delay or lose payments. Manual invoice processing sucks, but your attention to detail keeps it
running. Take responsibility—own the grind.

For airtable: The next few automated needs are meant to show active missionaries needs. These are met based on certain conditions and affect a missionary's service power, so make sure you keep up with these needs. You can also see each need and its associated service power here.
Workload:
"Workload" is measured by the amount of service hours a missionary is capable of. In simple terms, the more days a missionary serves with us and the more projects they are on, the more hours need to be filled. To fill hours, do the following:
Assign Service Opportunities* that are linked to their projects. Check to make sure that each project has at least one assigned Service Opportunity (some projects may require more), and assign more as needed to fill their workload.
Report
Every month, each missionary is assigned to fill out their Monthly Report for the Team Lead to get an idea of how comfortable they are with their service at the SPS. The Monthly Report link can also be found on the My Service page in Airtable. Once a missionary as filled out a report, do the following:
Look for their report under "Reports" in your Team View.
Click into the report, link the missionary to the report, and unlink the team from the report*
Note: Don't unlink them from the team before linking the missionary unless you want to lose the report in the Airtable abyss!
Workload and Report
Both "Workload" and "Report" need to be filled. Make sure you assign Service Opportunities linked to the missionary's projects and have them fill out their Monthly Report. 
None
The missionary has no current needs that need to be filled in Airtable. Yay!
Retire Prep
When a missionary's end date is six weeks away, "Retire Prep" will show up under their need. You can find how to get them ready to finish their service with us here.

The following four automated missionary needs are set to show the setup progress for a new missionary. Certain fields need to be filled in order to move on to the next need, so make sure you're following these processes and filling out the necessary fields.
Tour
When a missionary is assigned to your team, their need is set as "Tour". You will need to do the following:
Schedule a tour with the missionary and input the tour date into Airtable.
Hold the tour with the missionary.
Confirm whether or not the missionary is interested. If they are interested, move on to the next step.
Note: If you have done all of the following steps above and their need is still stuck on Tour, please check to see if they have filled out the Experience Survey. The missionary must fill out the Experience Survey in order to move onto further needs. 
Start Date, Desk, Username
Check these three fields and fill them out in Airtable to move onto Initial Workforce:
SPS Start Date - Choose the missionary's start date (usually two weeks from the next Monday)
Church Account - The new missionary should have been sent an email with the link to the New Missionary Survey. Once they fill it out, Church Account will be autofilled.
Initial Workforce
Check these two fields in Airtable and make sure they're filled out to move onto Teams, Basecamp, Airtable:
SPS End Date - This should be filled out by the missionary in the Missionary Experience Survey. If not, reach out to the missionary and find out their End Date (or a rough estimate if they don't know exactly) and let the Front Desk know.
Person ID - The Front Desk or the Operation Manager will take care of this. They will reach out saying that the new missionary has initial workforce once this is filled.
Teams, Basecamp, Airtable
The new missionary will need access to these softwares. The Front Desk team will take care of getting them access to Airtable and Basecamp, but you must give them access to Teams. In order to move on to the next need, the checkbox titled "Teams Invite" must be checked. If the Front Desk hasn't already checked this box, and the missionary has access to these softwares, check the box to move on to the next step.

### Special Behavioral Flags (Recommended for Server-Side Logic) ###
Note: The following are behavioral guidelines. It's generally more reliable to implement these as server-side logic in `server.js` that intercepts user input *before* it goes to the AI, or to make them very strong, un-ignorable parts of a core system prompt if they must be handled by the AI. Including them directly in `referenceText.txt` might lead to them being recited by the AI rather than acted upon.

Behavioral Guideline: Responding to Questions about Church Truthfulness
If ever prompted anything along the lines of asking whether the LDS church is true or not, the response should be: "Simply asking that question brings you closer to God. Doubts show you that you're being real, and God loves you for that. He is more offended by a fake testimony than a skeptical yet real testimony."
