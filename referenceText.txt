Service Missionary Contributions within the Publishing Services Department at the Church Office Building of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
I. Introduction: Contextualizing Missionary Service within Church Publishing Operations
A. The Enduring Role of Publishing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

Since its inception, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has placed a profound emphasis on publishing as a primary means of disseminating its doctrines, supporting its global membership, and meticulously documenting its history and ongoing revelations. This commitment is evidenced by the extensive operations of its Publishing Services Department (PSD), a large and multifaceted organization responsible for a wide array of media. The Church Office Building (COB) in Salt Lake City, Utah, serves as the central administrative hub for these and other worldwide operations, housing the personnel and infrastructure necessary to manage a global church. The production and distribution of scriptures, manuals, magazines, digital resources, and audiovisual materials are fundamental to the Church’s efforts to teach the gospel, strengthen faith, and provide guidance to its members across the globe.

B. The Contribution of Service Missionaries to Church Operations

Parallel to its well-known proselytizing missionary program, the Church also utilizes a robust service missionary program. Service missionaries are individuals who dedicate their time and talents to support the diverse operational needs of the Church, often working within its various departments and facilities. These missionaries, who include Young Service Missionaries (YCSM) and Senior Service Missionaries, contribute significantly at Church Headquarters and other locations, undertaking assignments tailored to their skills and the Church's requirements. The Church's reliance on these varied forms of missionary service reflects a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach to accomplishing its extensive global mission. Given the vast scale of its operations , service missionaries fill essential roles that might otherwise necessitate additional paid staff or result in unmet needs, allowing the Church to leverage the commitment of its members in diverse and impactful ways.

C. Addressing the "Service Project Shop": Defining a Functional Concept

The term "Service Project Shop," as specified in the inquiry, does not appear as an officially documented name for a specific physical location or formally titled unit within the Publishing Services Department in available resources. However, it is plausible that this term refers to a functional area or a collection of project-based service opportunities where missionaries contribute to the work of the PSD at the Church Office Building. This interpretation is supported by documented examples of service missionaries being assigned to specific, project-oriented tasks within the department. The term itself, while informal, likely arises from an experiential understanding by missionaries or those observing their work. It suggests a hands-on, practical environment where tangible contributions are made, distinct from more abstract administrative or purely ecclesiastical roles. This report will therefore explore the nature of these service opportunities, the types of projects undertaken by missionaries, and the operational context of the PSD that facilitates such contributions.

D. Report Objectives and Structure

This report aims to provide a detailed explanation of how service missionaries contribute to the Publishing Services Department at the Church Office Building. It will delineate the core functions and operational scope of the PSD, describe the framework of service missionary involvement, illustrate the types of projects and tasks these missionaries undertake, and provide an overview of how the PSD operates. Through this structured approach, the report seeks to clarify the significant role service missionaries play within the Church's extensive publishing endeavors.

II. The Publishing Services Department (PSD): Mandate, Structure, and Key Functions
A. Core Mission and Mandate of the PSD

The Publishing Services Department (PSD) of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints operates under the direction of the Presiding Bishopric. Its fundamental mission is to produce and disseminate materials and messages that invite all of God's children to come unto Jesus Christ. A key purpose of the PSD is to ensure that the publishing needs of the Church's global Areas are met, thereby supporting efforts to share the gospel and provide resources for Church members and local leaders. This broad mandate encompasses the creation, production, translation, and distribution of a vast array of materials essential for worship, instruction, and the administrative functions of the Church worldwide.

B. Scope and Scale of PSD Operations

The PSD is a substantial department, reportedly comprising approximately 1,000 individuals and managing a significant volume of digital assets, estimated at around 8 petabytes of media storage. Its operations span a wide spectrum of media formats, including traditional print materials such as magazines (e.g., the Liahona, Friend, and For the Strength of Youth), scriptures, and instructional manuals. The department is also heavily involved in digital media, overseeing the development and maintenance of Church websites and applications like the Gospel Library app. Furthermore, PSD's responsibilities extend to audio and video production, including major undertakings such as the Book of Mormon Videos series produced at the LDS Motion Picture Studio, which falls under its purview.

The department's reach is global, reflecting the international nature of the Church. A critical function is the translation of materials into a multitude of languages—reportedly as many as 96—to serve a diverse worldwide membership. PSD also supports worldwide broadcasts and caters to the specific publishing needs of different geographical Areas. The sheer scale and technological diversity of PSD inherently create a continuous need for a flexible and varied support workforce. This demand often exceeds what can be met by full-time employees alone, particularly for project-based tasks or fluctuating workloads, making service missionaries a uniquely valuable resource. The department's explicit role in managing "volunteers" underscores this operational reality.

C. Key Functional Areas within PSD

The diverse responsibilities of the PSD are managed through several key functional areas:

Content Creation and Curation: This involves the development and refinement of curriculum materials, scriptures, official Church magazines, manuals for various organizations, and other textual and multimedia content designed for instruction, inspiration, and edification.
Editorial Services: A crucial function ensuring the accuracy, clarity, doctrinal correctness, and stylistic consistency of all published materials, maintaining the Church's standards for official communications.
Translation Services: This area manages the complex process of translating Church materials into numerous languages. This is a significant logistical and qualitative undertaking, vital for making Church resources accessible to members globally.
Media Production: This includes the operations of the LDS Motion Picture Studio in Provo, Utah, which handles film, video, audio recording and mixing, visual effects (VFX), rendering, and color correction. The department also produces video news releases, public service announcements, and various audiovisual presentations for Church purposes.
Digital Product Management: This encompasses the development, maintenance, enhancement, and support for the Church’s digital platforms, including the widely used Gospel Library mobile application and official Church websites.
Print Production and Distribution: This area oversees the physical printing of books, magazines, pamphlets, and other materials, as well as their global distribution to Church units, members, and affiliated organizations.
Area Support and Liaison: Designated personnel, such as Area Publishing Services Managers, work directly with Area Presidencies and other local leaders around the world to identify and fulfill their specific publishing needs. These managers act as a vital bridge between the Areas and the resources available at PSD headquarters. The dynamic workflow created by these global demands implies a need for adaptable support resources at the headquarters level to manage these diverse requests.
Internal Support and Tools: The PSD also develops and utilizes internal tools, such as survey instruments, to gather feedback and support various Church programs and initiatives.
D. Organizational Context

The Publishing Services Department is primarily located within the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, the administrative headquarters of the Church. Operationally, the PSD is structured to manage relationships not only with its internal staff but also with external resources, including volunteers, independent contractors, and commercial vendors. This framework explicitly allows for the integration of service missionaries into its workflows. The historical integration of previously separate departments—such as those responsible for audiovisual production, translation, and curriculum development—into the unified PSD  suggests a strategic move towards centralized control and synergy in messaging and production. While this consolidation aims for greater efficiency and consistency, it also inherently increases internal complexity and the need for robust support mechanisms to ensure smooth operations across diverse teams and functions.

III. Service Missionary Involvement in Publishing Services
A. Overview of the Church's Service Missionary Program

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints offers various avenues for members to serve as missionaries, extending beyond traditional proselytizing roles. The service missionary program is a significant component of this effort, providing opportunities for individuals to contribute their skills and time to the Church's operational needs. The formalization and expansion of this program, including testing since 2014 and subsequent broader implementation , indicates a growing recognition by Church leadership of the value and necessity of this type of service to sustain complex operations like those found in the PSD.

Young Service Missionaries (YCSM):
This program is designed for young single men, typically aged 18–25, and young single women, aged 19–29. These individuals usually serve locally while living at home. Their assignments are carefully tailored to their individual talents, skills, gifts, and circumstances, as well as to the specific needs of the Church operation or approved community organization where they serve. YCSMs are often those who have been honorably excused from serving proselytizing missions for health or other valid considerations, or who may have returned home early from a proselytizing mission and wish to continue their service in a different capacity. They may serve in various Church operations, approved non-profit community organizations, or stake-assigned service opportunities. The duration of service for YCSMs is typically 6–24 months for young men and 6–18 months for young women.

Senior Service Missionaries:
Senior service missionaries include men and women over the age of 40, who may be single or married couples. Like YCSMs, their assignments are suited to their individual capabilities and the needs of the area or department they support. They can serve locally while living at home or may serve away from home in various capacities, supporting local Church leaders, facilities, temples, and charitable initiatives. Their service duration typically ranges from 6 to 23 months. The Utah Salt Lake City Headquarters Mission provides a clear model for this type of service, where senior missionaries (alongside some full-time missionaries) contribute to various Church departments, including Family History and Church History, undertaking a diverse range of tasks such as research assistance, records processing, and patron support.

B. Assignment Process to Departments like PSD

The process for assigning missionaries to service roles, including those within departments like the PSD, is structured and overseen by Church leadership. Since early 2019, all young missionary candidates in the United States and Canada utilize the same online recommendation system. They are initially considered for full-time proselytizing missions. Those who, for various physical, mental, or emotional health reasons, are unable to serve in a proselytizing capacity may then be called as service missionaries.

Missionary calls, whether for proselytizing or service, are issued by the President of the Church. For service missionaries, particularly YCSMs, local priesthood leaders (such as bishops and stake presidents) play a role in identifying potential service opportunities. They can consult resources like the Church Directory of Organizations and Leaders (CDOL) or work with Church-service missionary (CSM) group coordinators to find suitable placements within Church operations. Service mission leader couples, operating under the direction of the local mission president, are instrumental in the day-to-day aspects of the program. They help find appropriate service opportunities and match missionaries with assignments that align with their circumstances and the needs of the receiving Church department or operation.

C. The Nature of Service in the Publishing Services Department

Direct evidence confirms that service missionaries are actively engaged in meaningful roles within the Publishing Services Department. For instance, Elder Joseph Horne, a young service missionary, was assigned to PSD where he provided technical and user support for the Gospel Library app. Similarly, Sister Juarez, another service missionary within PSD, was tasked with providing leadership and training to new service missionaries assigned to the department. These examples clearly demonstrate that service missionaries are integrated into core departmental functions. The assignment of a service missionary to train other new service missionaries within PSD suggests a potentially significant and ongoing presence of these individuals, possibly organized into teams or cohorts. This lends credence to the idea of a "shop" or hub of activity where service missionaries collaborate on various projects.

Given the breadth of PSD's responsibilities (as outlined in Section II), service missionaries likely support various functional areas. Their work is often project-based, aligning with the implication of the term "Service Project Shop." Many tasks within PSD, such as producing the Book of Mormon Videos , managing app development , or publishing global magazines , are inherently part of larger projects with defined deliverables and timelines.

Service missionaries in PSD would typically work in an office environment at the Church Office Building , collaborating with full-time Church employees and potentially contractors. They contribute to team efforts, supporting the work of professionals. For example, a PSD production coordinator role involves working with project team members across different divisions , and service missionaries could provide valuable assistance within such teams. Furthermore, the emphasis on tailoring assignments to missionaries' "talents, skills, and gifts"  means that PSD likely benefits from a diverse skill set brought by these individuals. This could include specialized abilities in media, technology, languages, project management, or organizational tasks that are directly applicable to the complex demands of publishing projects.

IV. Illustrative Projects and Contributions by Service Missionaries in Publishing
Service missionaries contribute to the Publishing Services Department in a variety of ways, supporting its mission to produce and disseminate materials that aid the Church's global efforts. While the term "Service Project Shop" may not denote a formal, physical space, it aptly describes the project-oriented environment where these missionaries apply their skills.

A. Documented Examples of Service Missionary Projects in PSD

The Church has publicly shared examples of service missionaries making significant contributions within the PSD:

Gospel Library App Support: Elder Joseph Horne, a young service missionary, was assigned to the Publishing Services Department to provide technical and user support for the Gospel Library app. This app is a critical digital resource for millions of Church members worldwide, providing access to scriptures, manuals, magazines, and other materials.

Potential tasks involved in such a role could include: Responding to user inquiries submitted through feedback channels, troubleshooting common technical issues, meticulously testing new app updates before release, compiling and categorizing user feedback for development teams, and assisting in the creation or updating of support documentation and FAQs for users. The assignment of service missionaries to such a high-visibility, member-facing product underscores the trust the Church places in these individuals and the critical nature of their contributions. It is far from peripheral work; rather, it is integral to the user experience of a flagship digital product.
Leadership and Training within PSD Service Missionary Cohorts: Sister Juarez, also a service missionary in PSD, was given the responsibility of providing leadership and training to new service missionaries joining the department.

Potential tasks involved in this capacity might include: Onboarding new service missionaries by familiarizing them with departmental procedures and expectations, explaining specific project goals and tasks, mentoring them as they adapt to their roles, and possibly coordinating certain tasks or projects among a group of service missionaries.
B. Inferred and Potential Project Areas Based on PSD Functions & General Service Missionary Roles

Drawing from the known functions of the PSD and the general types of assignments given to service missionaries in Church office settings , several other project areas can be inferred:

Administrative and Office Support: This is a common area for service missionary contributions across various Church departments.

Tasks: Data entry for project tracking or contact lists, filing and organizing documents (both physical and digital), assisting with scheduling meetings or managing calendars for teams, preparing materials for presentations or training sessions, handling routine correspondence, maintaining departmental records, assisting with financial queries or the compilation of production performance reports, and general documentation maintenance.
Relevance: Such support is vital for the smooth day-to-day operation of diverse PSD teams, including editorial, production, translation, and digital product groups.
Content Preparation and Management (Pre-Press & Digital): With the vast amount of textual and media content PSD processes , support in this area is highly valuable.

Tasks: Proofreading manuscripts or digital content for errors, performing basic copyediting tasks under supervision, transcribing audio or video content for records or accessibility, applying tags and metadata to photos and media files for digital asset management systems, scanning and archiving historical documents or images, preparing content for upload to online platforms, and assisting with the processing of survey data. The Joseph Smith Papers Project, for instance, similarly relies on volunteers for tasks like transcription and verification within the Church History Department.
Relevance: These tasks are crucial for maintaining quality and ensuring the efficient management and discoverability of the Church's extensive content library.
Media Production Assistance (Supporting Roles): While highly technical roles in media production are typically filled by professionals, numerous support tasks are essential.

Tasks: Providing logistical support for photo or video shoots (e.g., organizing props, managing talent releases – if not requiring specialized legal knowledge), assisting with basic video editing or graphic design tasks (if the missionary possesses relevant skills and adequate supervision is provided), organizing large volumes of media files, conducting research for upcoming productions, or assisting with the setup and teardown of equipment for local events.
Relevance: PSD is responsible for significant media output, including large-scale projects like the Book of Mormon Videos. The potential for service missionaries to be involved in tasks like media tagging, transcription, and archival assistance points to their role in making the Church's vast historical and current media assets more accessible and usable for future projects and for members globally.
Translation Support (Non-Linguistic or Basic Linguistic Tasks): The PSD's translation efforts into 96 languages involve immense logistical and administrative work beyond the core act of translation.

Tasks: Formatting translated documents to match source layouts, assisting with terminology database entry or management under the guidance of linguists, coordinating the flow of files between translators and reviewers, performing quality checks for completeness or formatting consistency (rather than linguistic accuracy, unless the missionary is skilled in the specific language).
Relevance: Area Publishing Services Managers oversee translation resources, which can include volunteers , indicating a structured role for such support.
Digital Product Support (Beyond Gospel Library): PSD manages various digital outputs beyond just the Gospel Library app.

Tasks: Assisting with the testing of other Church websites or internal applications, compiling user feedback from various sources for these platforms, and assisting with routine content updates on Church web pages.
Event and Logistical Support: Large departments like PSD often have ongoing internal logistical needs.

Tasks: Assisting with preparations for internal PSD meetings, training sessions, or workshops; coordinating the assembly and distribution of materials for such events.
C. The "Service Project Shop" Environment

The "Service Project Shop," understood as a functional concept, likely describes a collaborative environment or a series of coordinated efforts. Here, service missionaries work on specific, assigned tasks that contribute to larger PSD projects and goals. This environment would be characterized by:

Defined Tasks and Deliverables: Missionaries would be given clear assignments with expected outcomes.
Interaction and Collaboration: They would interact regularly with PSD staff who supervise their work and with other service missionaries, fostering a team atmosphere.
Use of Church Resources: Access to Church office equipment, software, and systems necessary to complete their assigned tasks would be provided.
Adherence to Standards: Missionaries would be expected to adhere to departmental standards for quality, confidentiality, and deadlines, operating within the demanding, deadline-driven environment that characterizes publishing operations.
The variety of potential projects, ranging from administrative to technical and media-related, suggests that this "Service Project Shop" concept accommodates a wide spectrum of missionary skills and interests. This aligns perfectly with the service missionary program's stated goal of tailoring assignments to the individual's capabilities and the organization's needs , making the service missionary contingent a versatile and valuable resource hub for the PSD.

V. How the Publishing Services Department Works: Operational Dynamics
A. Project Initiation and Workflow

Projects within the Publishing Services Department are initiated to meet a wide range of needs stemming from Church leadership, particularly the Presiding Bishopric , various other Church departments requiring published materials or media, and the Church's global Areas which often have specific local requirements. The process typically involves close collaboration with these initiating departments or Area leaders to clearly understand the strategic objectives, target audience, and desired deliverables for each product.

Once a project is approved and defined, it likely follows standard publishing industry workflows, adapted to the Church's specific context. This generally includes stages such as:

Content Development: Creation of original text, scripts, or media concepts.
Editorial Review: Thorough review for accuracy, clarity, doctrinal soundness, and adherence to Church style.
Design and Layout: Visual design for print or digital formats.
Media Production: If applicable, this involves filming, recording, animation, etc.
Translation: Adaptation of content into multiple languages.
Pre-press/Digital Formatting: Preparation of files for printing or digital deployment.
Production/Printing: Manufacturing of physical copies or deployment to digital platforms.
Distribution: Global dissemination of the final product.
The complex interplay between the centralized PSD headquarters, which provides core resources and maintains global standards, and the decentralized needs of the Church's Areas worldwide creates a continuous flow of diverse projects. This dynamic necessitates a flexible support system, such as that provided by service missionaries, which proves highly valuable for managing fluctuating demands and accommodating specialized local requirements.

B. Resource Management

The PSD manages a substantial workforce, estimated at around 1,000 staff members , to carry out its extensive mandate. A key aspect of its operational model involves the effective management of various human resources, including not only full-time employees but also volunteers, independent contractors, and external vendors. Service missionaries are an important component of this "volunteer" category. The formal inclusion of "managing volunteers" in the job descriptions of some PSD staff members indicates that service missionary involvement is not an ad-hoc arrangement but rather an integrated and planned part of PSD's operational strategy and human resource planning.

Effective resource management also extends to meticulous budget forecasting, comprehensive resource planning for personnel and materials, and rigorous timeline management for all projects. These practices are crucial for delivering products efficiently and responsibly.

C. Technology and Infrastructure

The Publishing Services Department leverages significant technological infrastructure to support its operations. This includes substantial investment in media storage capacity, with approximately 8 petabytes of data under management, and advanced production technologies, particularly within the LDS Motion Picture Studio, which handles sophisticated film, video, and audio work. The department utilizes relevant industry-standard software for monitoring and controlling the execution of publishing projects, ensuring efficiency and quality. Furthermore, PSD relies on robust digital platforms, such as the Gospel Library app and official Church websites, for the global delivery of content to members.

D. Quality Control and Standards

A primary objective for PSD is to meet the publishing needs of the Church's Areas in a manner that is both "simple and affordable," while consistently delivering value and upholding the Church's message. To achieve this, production coordination processes are in place to ensure that all projects adhere to predefined operational procedures, allocated budgets, established timelines, and qualitative standards. Routine quality checks are integrated into the workflow at various stages of production to maintain high standards for all published materials.

E. Collaboration and Communication

Effective collaboration and communication are vital to the functioning of the PSD. Staff members often serve as liaisons, bridging communication between Area leadership around the world and the resources available at PSD headquarters. Internally, there is extensive coordination of work among project team members across different divisions within PSD, as well as with external stakeholders such as vendors and other Church departments. The work environment is described as demanding and often high-stress, with frequently changing requirements and tight deadlines, necessitating strong teamwork and clear, consistent communication among all involved parties. In such an environment, service missionaries likely handle well-defined, supportive tasks that enable full-time specialists to focus their expertise on the most complex or urgent aspects of projects. This division of labor allows for greater overall efficiency, as service missionaries can take on essential supporting duties (such as data entry, basic formatting, logistical assistance, or initial triage of user support requests) that, while crucial, do not require the same depth of professional experience, thereby freeing up specialized personnel.

VI. Conclusion: The Integral Role of Service Missionaries in Fulfilling the PSD's Mission
A. Summary of Service Missionary Contributions to PSD

Service missionaries play a multifaceted and valuable role within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Publishing Services Department. While the term "Service Project Shop" does not appear as an official designation in available documentation, the underlying concept of missionaries engaging in project-based work that directly supports the department's objectives is clearly evident from examples of their assignments and the operational structure of PSD. These contributions span a range of essential functions, including direct support for critical digital products like the Gospel Library app, leadership and training within service missionary cohorts, administrative and office support, assistance in various stages of content preparation and management, logistical aid for media production, and support for translation processes. Their work is integrated into the daily operations of a department that is central to the Church's global communication and teaching efforts.

B. Value and Impact of These Contributions

The contributions of service missionaries provide indispensable support that enables the PSD to manage its vast workload and meet the ever-expanding global publishing demands of a growing Church. By dedicating their time and skills, these individuals allow for a more efficient and often more economical use of Church resources, freeing up professional staff to focus on highly specialized tasks.

Beyond the operational benefits to the department, service missionary assignments offer profound personal value to the missionaries themselves. These opportunities provide a platform for meaningful service, the development of valuable life and professional skills, and significant spiritual growth, fostering a deeper connection to their faith and the Church's mission. This dual benefit—supporting the Church's work while nurturing individual discipleship—is a hallmark of the service missionary program.

C. The Future of Service Missionary Involvement in Church Publishing

Given the ongoing expansion of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints worldwide and the increasing complexity and diversity of media and publishing technologies, the need for dedicated service missionary support within PSD and similar departments is likely to continue and potentially grow. The established model of integrating service missionaries into departmental workflows, as demonstrated within PSD and other Church headquarters departments like Family History , represents a sustainable and effective approach to meeting extensive operational needs.

The Church Office Building offers a 70% discount to service missionaries and employees, resulting in the average cost for a lunch being roughly 3-4 dollars. Food is high quality, healthy, and offers variety.

There are roughly 8-10 total teams in the SPS. Each team holding about 8-12 missionaries. 2 of those teams are virtual, and the rest are in-person. Team leads hold weekly 1:1's with each missionary for about 30 minutes, discussing their projects, wellbeing, hours, attendance, and get-to-know-you questions. Projects, on the other hand, there are roughly 60-80 projects total. They have no limit on how many missionaries can be on a project. Some projects have upwards 30 missionaries. Some only have 1 missionary. Each project has a project coordinator, who is a service missionary. They are responsible for teaching new missionaries about the particular project, and, by keeping the project alive in general.

Missionaries may work a minimum of 3 days per week. Missionaries may choose their schedule. Service hours are from 9am to 4pm Monday through Friday. Each morning at 9am, there is a 15 minute huddle by team. During these 15 minutes, they begin with an opening prayer, speak the service missionary purpose, then announcements, then a spiritual thought is given by an assigned missionary, and then accountability rounds with a question of the day. An hour long lunch break is from 12pm to 1pm. At 1pm, all missionaries in the SPS gather for 30 mins for Elevate Program on Mondays and Wednesdays, and Gospel Study on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is an attendance roster/sheet, and team leads/ Assistant Team Leads (ATL's) or managers are responsible for taking attendance. Missionaries are accountable for being late, absent, or leaving early for morning meeting, afternoon meeting, and being at work in general.

The successful integration of service missionaries into a technologically advanced and professionally demanding department like the Publishing Services Department  not only highlights the capabilities and dedication of these individuals but also sets a precedent. It provides a valuable model that can inform and encourage the broader application of the service missionary program across other Church departments, enabling them to similarly leverage this dedicated and skilled resource to further the diverse aspects of the Church's global mission. As the Church continues to adapt to new communication methods and reach wider audiences, the contributions of service missionaries will remain an integral part of its publishing and outreach efforts.

Literacy Mentoring
This ongoing project provides service missionaries
the opportunity to mentor Church Employees who
have enrolled in a literacy program meant to improve
their reading and communication opportunities. You
are committing to serve in the assignment for a
minimum of 6 months. After a training period, this
service requires about an hour a week working with
your student and helping them become more
successful in the program. If you speak another
language, the Requestor will try to pair you up with
someone who speaks that language.
You will first learn the Literacy training program and
then begin mentoring an employee who does not
speak English as their first language.

Music Tool Transcriptions
Language Collection New Music - Translation Input
Each New Collection music language project is in
need of help with inputting existing translations of
hymns from the 1985/1989 hymn products into the
music translation tool. This will require general
comfort with navigating the characters of another
language (no knowledge of the language required),
including inputting proper letters with diacritics
(accents, etc). This will also require knowledge of
music notation, since the proper syllables need to be
matched to the right notes with the translation tool.
Once hymns are input (including proper
syllabification), translation teams will then evaluate
the quality of the translations.
The service missionary (or missionaries) can
complete the work at whatever pace they desire as
long as general deadlines --as applicable-- as asked
by the Requestor Matt Curtis are fulfilled.
It is anticipated that each hymn will take about 30
minutes to input into the translation tool, with
variation per missionary.
As this project is a prerequisite for the Hymnbook
team to work on releasing "Hymns- For Home and
Church", the amount of languages we will be
inputting for in the tool-- and thus number of
hymns-- is likely to increase overtime as we get
closer to the anticipated release of the first version
of the new Hymnbook.
All missionaries assigned to this project will need
special access to the music translation tool.
As of May 2025, Languages for this project are;
Completed: Italian, Hungarian, Samoan, Dutch,
Finnish, Cebuano
In Progress: Armenian, Russian, Tongan, Ukrainian,
Thai, Chinese, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Polish,
Romanian, Lithuanian, ASL Timing, Euro-Portuguese
However, there are dozens more languages

Temple Painting Finishing
Temple Paintings Post Photography Production
Work
We need two missionaries to work with a full-time
photography designer to perform the following:
1. Using Photoshop tool/skills to clean up the
images.
2. Catalogue the images (including all metadata)
in an Excel spreadsheet
3. Create multiple sizes of each image
4. Update the Temple Painting Catalog with the
new images. (This catalog is used by Temple
Interior Designers to choose paintings for
Temples that are being constructed.
Amount of time needed
There is currently a back log of this work that needs
to be accomplished (est. 100 hours including
training). After the back log, it will be 3-10 hours a
week, but this will vary greatly on the number of new
paintings that are shot the previous week.
This will be an ongoing project. One year of service
or more is preferred.

Temple Square Interviews
Writing Stories for Friend Magazine
This project will require one to two missionaries.
Though having two would probably make it easier.
We will get a list of Temple Square missionaries to be
interviewed. Elder Salmond from the Friend
Magazine will train the missionaries on how to do
interviews, and then they will conduct the interviews
with the Temple Square missionaries. I'm not sure
how many hours it will take, because that depends
on how many Temple Square missionaries we get to
interview.
Those assigned to interview, will interview the
Temple Square missionaries about any of their
childhood experiences/stories for the Freind. Then
they will also ask if they have any additional contacts
from their home country that the Friend Magazine
could use to reach out to for more international
stories from kids.
The Temple Square mission is providing twelve sister
missionaries to be interviewed. We interviewed 10
sisters and are now writing the stories we were given
back.

Proof of Concept - SM App
Service Missionary App PoC
The Missionary Department and ICS are teaming up
to do a proof-of-concept application for Service
Missionaries to use for their mission experience.
This is a very early project with a lot of flexibility as
far as what features this app will provide. It is a
great opportunity to bring your own ideas and to
help work with other missionaries and leaders to
gather ideas on the features & benefits that they
would like to see.
Teaching Missionaries use the Preach My Gospel
App. Today, it is based on a platform that only works
on Android. We are targeting a platform for this PoC
that will allow this app to run on Android, iOS, and
Web.
The primary skills we would need would be some
UX/UI design and also some frontend programming.
We could use a couple of missionaries who can help
gather ideas and design potential features to help
the team know what to implement. If needed, one
could be more communications/business focused
and the other could be more UX/UI focused. Also,
we will need a few missionaries with Low Code /
Microsoft Power Platform knowledge who can help
implement those features. Experience in HTML/CSS
and JavaScript/TypeScript is needed. If you are
excited about the project, don't have those exact
skills, but are technical and willing to learn - then
let's talk. Even if you are good with spreadsheets
and formulas, we want to talk with you!
We are really excited about having missionaries
involved in the creation of this app and will help
Service DaysService Days Skills and Tools Required

positive and successful experience.

Referral Response
Online Teaching Center - Referral Response
Missionaries will log into the referral system and
respond to individuals that have reached out to learn
more about the church and the gospel. You will
communicate over teaching center, text first and
then call. Missionaries will be paired up for
accountability purposes but you will do most of your
work on your own. You will get the opportunity to
find the needs of the people you work with and
possibly share some of the gospel with them before
referring them off to their local missionaries.
This project is ongoing. This project is flexible for
time. A study of the Preach My Gospel is required.
We can use as many missionaries as possible

Third Floor Space Observational
Study
Two to four missionaries needed (based on who
serves every day throughout the week, workload,
etc.) to walk through every area of the Third Floor
East Wing of the COB to observe how many people
are in each area, who is using the space and how
they are using it. Observations will be logged in a
provided spreadsheet.
1. The number of people in a given area are to be
tallied - or if no one is there, mark zero.
2. A very brief description of the activity is to be
noted (or circled if provided in the spreadsheet)
3. If anyone questions what is happening, a brief
explanation of behavior mapping is appropriate,
followed by a simple inquiry of "how do you like
the space, what is your favorite element about
the space, how could it be improved?"
4. It is important to remain quiet, respectful and in
the background as much as possible.
5. If any questions arise, reach out to Bill.

Nuxeo Stock Footage
Asset Management / Removing Tags from B-roll
Footage in Nuxeo
Nuxeo (the Church's content management system)
has thousands of tags that have been added to B-roll
media. We need help removing tags that don't apply
so that only tags that relate to the shots are left. At
the moment, we have 30,000 +B-roll shots in Nuxeo.
This work could potentially take anywhere from 6
months to a year to complete, and the work would
require someone (or multiple people) to go through
one tag at a time, preview every single shot in the
results, and then remove tags that shouldn't be
there. There is also an excel spreadsheet to help with
this effort.

Magazine Quality Assurance
Magazine Publishing Quality Assurance
Each month, Church magazines (Liahona, For the
Strength of Youth, Friend, and the Monthly Message)
are published digitally in Gospel Library in many
languages. Publishing the magazine includes
publishing all the articles, associated audio files,
downloadable PDFs, as well as links to other formats
such as DAISY and braille.
The Magazines team is looking to enlist some service
missionaries to help with the quality assurance
portion of the publishing process.
What this means is that each month, after we have
completed all of the publishing for the magazine, we
will need a missionary to go through and check every
link and article in every language to make sure that
nothing was missed.
We have a very easy to use spreadsheet with all of
the items to look for on each language publication,
and the missionary would simply need to click
through Gospel Library and mark things off as
complete if they are published properly. Any issues
would be documented in the spreadsheet, and then
the magazine team will resolve them.
This is an ongoing project, with tasks due every
month. We use Workfront to manage the tasks, so
the assigned missionary would be able to work off of
a task queue.
When a Quality Assurance task is ready to start,
whoever is assigned to it will be notified and they
can get to work on it right away. We typically prefer a
quality check to be completed within 5 days.
This is such an important part of the magazine
production process, but sadly we just do not have
the time to devote to the Quality Check to do it

Sacred Materials
Sacred Materials Coordination Team Support
The SM Coordination team provides services to five
clients (Introductory Materials, Music, Scripture,
Temple Translation, and Temple Audio Production).
For all of them we have quite a few time consuming
and repetitive processes that we would love and
appreciate support with. These are also fulfilling and
very important processes. These tasks are ongoing
and would probably require 2-3 service missionaries
assigned to 1-2 tasks each. This would probably
require 4-8 hours per missionary per week (this is an
estimated time commitment). We will be grateful for
any help that can be provided. We don't have a due
date for these ongoing tasks (each request has its
own due date, but these will repeat and new ones
will come in). I indicated end of 2024 below, just to
add a timeframe. Thank you!

Teens Read the Bible
Scripture Audio Review (Bible) - "Teens Read the
Bible"
Scriptures product has a relationship with a
volunteer outside group who has recorded the Book
of Mormon in English using volunteer teen voices. In
addition, the outside group is now recording the
Bible and would like help getting the recordings
done. The Church is preparing to publish their
content on Church channels but needs a content
review done, to make sure its complete, that
pronunciations (i.e. of unique names) are adequate,
and to note any other issues that need to be cleaned
up or redone. Must be a teen to participate in
recordings, but can help with QC of recordings if
older. Having editing skills for audio is a plus. See
the website for recording instructions:

PSD Admin Support
PSD Administrative Support
I need a missionary (preferably one that wants to be
an admin in the future) that I can train up to take over
some tasks. I want someone who is comfortable with
Teams, Outlook, Excel, Word and PowerPoint. I need
them to be able to answer our PSD Information Line,
come down and sit in our admin spaces when we are
all whisked away to meetings (a physical presence is
essential), and do “other duties as assigned.” This
will include taking care of our office supply needs,
helping us out with lunches, snacks, etc. I want
someone who (if I can get Shauna■s buy-in) would be
comfortable processing P-Card receipts. I■m thinking
I would want to set up an account (PSDAdmin), that
this and future missionaries could sign into,
receive/process emails, etc. I would need a
dedicated laptop (and phone) for them to use, etc. If
I do this right, it would be a full-time gig (setting time
aside for companion study and other missionary
meetings). I see the project as on-going.

Music Reference Files
Music Translation Tool—Reference Files
The music translation team needs help embedding
certain reference files into about 350 hymns within
the music translation tool. This will require general
comfort level with Sharepoint and comfort with
navigating basic functions within the music
translation tool. It is anticipated that it will take about
5-10 minutes per hymn, so a total of no more than
50 hours for the project. This can be done in small
spurts of time or in longer periods as needed. Ideally,
the reference files for all hymns would be added by
mid-December (due date flexible).

Next Day Services
This project focuses primarily on small-scale, time-
bound production projects from other departments
throughout the Church. These will potentially include
asset management (images, documents, and QR
codes), making posters and fliers for different
events, and other simple projects that can be done
within a day.
This project will function using a 'tiered-system,'
meaning that through progression missionaries will
be given a variety of ways to help with the projects
and the project load for each missionary will
progressively become more advanced as time goes
on.

will lead this effort from the creative side.
We would like to work with service missionaries to
find existing assets in Church Repositories (e.g.
Titan) that match specific criteria for the use on
flagship channels like web, social media, and media
library. Once the first set of assets has been
collected, the creative director will identify images
and video assets that work on those channels based
on stakeholder feedback.

AI Modeling and Database --
SPS
SPS AI Tools Development
In this project, we are working on setting up an AI
chatbot which missionaries can use to get project
recommendations based on their skills and interests.
Currently the goal is to create a bot for internal use,
but in the future we may open it up to missionaries
interested in serving at the SPS. If the AI turns out
well and proves useful the SPS, the missionary
department may be interested in having us help with
creating a bot available to all service missionaries
which will help them find service sites.
We are working with Copilot Studio to create our
chatbot, which will allow missionaries to easily
interact with it through teams or through other
methods once we open it up to missionaries outside
of the SPS. As part of creating the bot, we must
extensively test it to make sure it gives good
recommendations and doesn't break partway
through. We also have to be able to feed it the
information it needs from Airtable, which requires
use of Power Automate to automatically pull project
info from Airtable using the API, and putting that
Service DaysService DaysService DaysService Days information into a database on Dataverse,

Malayam Text Transfer
Technical support for the Malayalam translation of
Gospel Fundamentals
We have a translation of an previous version of the
Gospel Fundamentals book into Malayalam. The
format of the translation does not match what is
currently in use for our production process, and
there are probably some changes or discrepancies in
the text, though they should be minor.
The project is to bring the text from the outdated file
into a fresh translation file. I believe that the book
itself is a few hundred pages long, and this will need
to be done on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis with
some intermittent checking (for example, via Google
Translate) to verify that we have the right text in the
right place. Beyond that, it's hard for me to specify
the scope, except to say that if you have an
innovative way to solve the issue, it is welcome.

Fleet Service Center Dashboard
Discovery / first meeting will be on Wednesday,
May 7th. On hold until then.
Currently the Fleet Service Center uses an Access
Database to manage when vehicles need to be
serviced. It tracks incoming vehicles and what is
needed to put these into service. The system is
setup that each vehicle serviced has a day of the
month they come in. We need to get off the Access
database and would like help in building a Power App
which will provide the same information. We would
like to build this in Microsoft Power Platform, using a
Canvas or Model Driven app. We can have the
database tables created. The main user Casey Ames
would like to be part of building the app so she can
learn and maintain the app going forward.

AI Accuracy with Questions
About the Church
This project is a study to find out how accurate the
information is that AI models give about the Church.
I want to help with coming up with a list of important
questions that people may ask about Church, and
then to test those questions against the top AI LLM's
with a group of different people asking the
questions. I would anticipate that 1-2 people would
lead this project, but 5-7, or more missionaries would
be participants in asking the questions to the AI
models and providing answers.

Here are the project skills and categories based on the text provided.

For individuals with strong organizational skills and a meticulous eye for detail, a variety of projects center around the use of **Microsoft Excel**. The "Youth Music Asset Organization" project requires consolidating song information, titan IDs, versions, and languages from the last seven to eight years into spreadsheets, with an initial focus on compiling download links. Similarly, the "Temple Painting Finishing" project involves cataloging image metadata in an Excel spreadsheet as part of the post-photography production workflow. In the "PSD Finance" project, missionaries use Excel alongside other systems to manage invoice workflows and ensure financial accuracy. The "SEO Publishing" project leverages Excel to assist with technical SEO tasks, such as tracking URLs and managing data for updating canonicals and internal links. Finally, the "Elite Attendance Roster Development" project is specifically focused on innovating and creating a new attendance roster in Excel or Google Sheets to improve productivity and accountability for leadership. These roles are perfect for those who enjoy structuring data, maintaining accuracy across large datasets, and using spreadsheets to create order and facilitate processes.

A significant number of projects are tailored for individuals with strong **Communication** skills, often involving direct interaction with others, writing, and mentoring. The "Literacy Mentoring" program offers an opportunity to mentor Church employees, helping them improve their reading and communication, a role that requires patience and a commitment of at least six months. The "Referral Response" project places missionaries on the front lines, communicating via text and phone with individuals who have reached out to learn about the church. For those interested in journalism and storytelling, the "Temple Square Interviews" project involves interviewing Temple Square missionaries to write stories for the *Friend* magazine. The "Elevate Program" requires creative writing and communication to update and promote a development program for missionaries. Other projects like "FSY Phone Support," "Disability Services," and "Church Communication Department Assistant" all rely heavily on clear, empathetic, and effective communication to assist with phone calls, support members with special needs, and manage departmental communications, respectively. These roles are ideal for empathetic individuals who are skilled at listening, explaining concepts clearly, and building rapport with diverse groups of people.

Projects that fall under the umbrella of **Technical Support** and **Database Operation** are designed for those with an interest in technology, problem-solving, and information management. The "QRS (Quality Resolution)" project involves maintaining content integrity on Gospel Library by managing queues and processing feedback tickets to fix issues. The "Meetinghouse As-Built" project requires inputting blueprints and construction records into a database archive. For those with more advanced technical skills, the "Proof of Concept - SM App" offers a chance to participate in UX/UI design and frontend programming for a new service missionary application, using skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The "Airtable Systems" project focuses on developing and adjusting the interfaces, automations, and formulas for the Service Project Shop's core systems. The "SPS Tech Support" team handles computer inventory, re-imaging setups, and providing direct tech assistance to other missionaries. These projects are a great fit for logical thinkers who are comfortable with software, enjoy troubleshooting, and are keen on learning about data management, web publishing, and application development.

A vibrant category of projects exists for those with a flair for the **Creative Arts**, encompassing everything from game development and illustration to graphic design and video production. The "MTC - Embark Game Development" project is a highly creative endeavor where participants design and develop language learning games, contributing to game concepts, storyboarding, artwork, and animation. The "Book of Mormon App Image Search" involves researching and finding quality, IP-compliant images for the app. Visual artists can contribute to "Missionary Painted Nametags" or create digital illustrations for the MTC's language app in the "Embark Vocabulary Images" project. The "Meetinghouse Signage" project requires proficiency in Adobe Illustrator to design and fulfill signage requests. Furthermore, the "Temple Painting Finishing" project uses Adobe Photoshop for cleaning up high-resolution images of temple paintings. Video production skills are sought for projects like "Service Connect (TSC) Video Editing" and "SM Testimonials," which involve editing footage to create welcome and testimonial videos. These opportunities are perfect for imaginative and artistic individuals who want to use their talents in visual design, storytelling, and digital creation to contribute to various Church initiatives.

For individuals who thrive in active, hands-on environments and enjoy public interaction, several projects require **Physical Services** and **Customer Service** skills. These roles are often in-person and essential to the smooth operation of Church facilities and events. The "Events' Headsets" project involves handing out interpretation headsets at the Conference Center, requiring a friendly and helpful demeanor. The "Vending" project is a physically demanding role that includes organizing food items, rotating stock, and lifting totes up to 50 lbs. The "Grounds" project offers a chance to work outdoors, assisting with the upkeep of the Temple Square grounds. The "Production Assistant" role provides hands-on support for various events and broadcasts. The "Front Desk/Administration" position is the "face" of the Service Project Shop, greeting visitors, answering calls, and handling administrative tasks. These projects are ideal for energetic individuals who enjoy being on their feet, working with their hands, and providing direct, tangible service to others.

There is a distinct need for individuals with meticulous attention to detail and a methodical approach to handle projects centered on **Data Analysis** and Quality Control. The "Family History Indexing" project, for instance, involves researching historical records to identify individuals for temple work, a task that demands precision and patience. The "Nuxeo Stock Footage" project requires missionaries to review thousands of B-roll media clips and remove inapplicable tags to improve the searchability of the Church's content management system. A similar attention to detail is needed for the "QC'DC" project, where missionaries perform quality checks on Doctrine and Covenants seminary lessons across 37 languages, ensuring all links and videos function correctly. The "Teens Read the Bible" project involves a content review of audio recordings to check for completeness and correct pronunciation. These roles are well-suited for individuals who are analytical, patient, and find satisfaction in ensuring the accuracy and quality of large volumes of information, contributing critically to the integrity of Church materials.

A personality type that could be described as the "tech-savvy and systems-oriented builder" would find a perfect fit in projects focused on creating, maintaining, and improving the technological infrastructure of various departments. Projects like "Airtable Systems," "AI Accuracy with Questions About the Church," and "Fleet Service Center Dashboard" are prime examples. These roles involve more than just user support; they require a deep dive into how systems work, from designing interfaces and automations in Airtable to building a Power App to replace an old Access database. The "SPS AI Tools Development" project is at the forefront of this, where missionaries develop and test an AI chatbot using Copilot Studio and Power Automate to provide project recommendations. This work involves API integration, database management in Dataverse, and extensive testing. These opportunities are ideal for innovative problem-solvers who are not only comfortable with technology but are also excited by the challenge of designing and implementing new solutions to improve efficiency and create better tools for others.

For individuals who are natural leaders and enjoy mentoring and managing teams, the "Team Leads" and "Assistant Team Leads" projects provide a formal structure to apply these skills. These roles are not tied to a single production task but are overarching leadership positions responsible for the well-being and productivity of their respective teams within the Service Project Shop (SPS). Team Leads and their Assistants spend their time supporting, training, and guiding other missionaries. Their responsibilities include holding regular meetings, facilitating new missionary orientation, identifying areas for improvement within SPS, and leading by example. These projects require a combination of skills including **Leadership**, communication, data analysis, and customer service. They are essential for maintaining a professional, respectful, and productive office environment and are suited for mature individuals who are organized, empathetic, and motivated to help others succeed in their assignments.
